Body Preview: Bombings in Moscow
Our thoughts and prayers are with the victims of this morning's bombings in Moscow, their families, and all the people
of Russia. This brutal assault on innocent civilians is another reminder that terrorism is a threat to peace-loving people
everywhere and must be met with unwavering resolve. I will offer my personal condolences to Foreign Minister Lavrov
later today in Ottawa. Together with our G8 partners, we will discuss how to improve international counterterrorism
coordination and cooperation. I was in Moscow earlier this month, and I know the resilience and determination of the
Russian people. The United States stands with them today and everyday in solidarity against violent extremism in all its
forms.

Body Preview: Thank you Madame Secretary the information you received from Jakarta is consistent with what we have now heard
from Indonesians. Scott and I just held an agency wide review of our collective Pacific wide efforts to date and where we
both need more information and where we are prepared to do more. Our team is doing a full accounting of every effort
to date and we will have this to you by mid afternoon. We are awaiting word from Luzon and I anticipate that we will
need to do much more there and in parts of Indonesia in the days ahead. We will be in touch with our interagency
colleagues throughout the day and will update you again accordingly. Thank you for your efforts and the readouts. I will
also do follow ups as you request. Best Kurt
