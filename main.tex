\title{CSPC 477 Final Project Proposal}


% The \author macro works with any number of authors. There are two commands
% used to separate the names and addresses of multiple authors: \And and \AND.
%
% Using \And between authors leaves it to LaTeX to determine where to break the
% lines. Using \AND forces a line break at that point. So, if LaTeX puts 3 of 4
% authors names on the first line, and the last on the second line, try using
% \AND instead of \And before the third author name.

\section{Project Overview}
\label{project_overview}

The goal of this project is to develop a scalable backend for natural language email search. The proposed system leverages state-of-the-art open-source technologies to build a hybrid search and ranking platform that integrates keyword-based and semantic retrieval methods. We use the Enron dataset, which contains approximately 500,000 emails generated by employees of the Enron Corporation.

\section{Proposed Approaches}

\textbf{Data Ingestion \& Storage.} Emails are subjected to text cleaning (using tools such as SpaCy and NLTK) to remove signatures, stopwords, and extraneous content, while key metadata is extracted. The cleaned metadata is stored in PostgreSQL with appropriate indexing and partitioning, and high-quality embeddings are precomputed using an open-source dense retrieval model (e.g., BGE or E5-Large). These embeddings are stored via FAISS for efficient retrieval.

\textbf{Query Expansion.} Upon receiving a query, a paraphrasing model (such as Flan-T5-Large) generates several variants. Each variant is processed in parallel to capture diverse linguistic expressions.

\textbf{Hybrid Search.} Each query variant is processed using two search methods. A BM25-based keyword search is performed on Elasticsearch over the indexed metadata, and a FAISS-based semantic search is conducted by converting each variant into an embedding (using the same model that was used to embed emails) and retrieving emails based on cosine similarity. Candidate results from both methods are merged, with duplicates removed and scores normalized using Min-Max scaling.

\textbf{Weighted Scoring and Re-Ranking.} The merged candidates are scored using a weighted combination of BM25 and FAISS similarity scores, with additional boosts for matches in critical metadata fields (such as specific dates or sender names). A neural re-ranking model (e.g., ColBERTv2 in full cross-attention mode) is then applied to the top 50--100 candidates to refine the final ordering.
